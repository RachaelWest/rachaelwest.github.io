                <p>
                    My interest in web development began in late 2019 during the Covid-19 pandemic when I decided to change careers. I had previously worked in journalism and communication roles for over 10 years but, after some soul searching, realised I needed a new challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                   My past roles involved writing content for digital products, including websites, and I have always been interested in how it all fits together. I was fortunate to work closely with designers and developers in the past and had the opportunity to watch them work.
                </p>
                <p>
                   I decided I wanted to do more than just write content for websites - I wanted to help build the product itself. I set out to learn the fundamentals of front-end development and haven't looked back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since then, I have completed a CIW-certified course from The Training Room and ten Codecademy courses (and counting!). I have also completed a certified course for Responsive Web Design and recently started Front End Development Libraries, both from freeCodeCamp. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also started the Frontend Developer Career Path by code-learning platform Scrimba a few months ago and continue to learn as much as I can.

                In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with friends out on walks or playing console and tabletop games. 
                I am a Dungeons and Dragons fan and would one day like to have the skills to develop an in-game tool using the Foundry platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also enjoy trying mini coding projects to practice with languages I have learned and will happily conduct research into possible solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I spend a lot of my time reading, particularly fiction and fantasy novels, history books, and the occasional autobiography.
