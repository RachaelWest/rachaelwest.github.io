                <p>
                    I am a communications specialist and former journalist with over 12 years of experience who is now looking for a new challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My past roles involved writing content for digital products, including websites, and I was fortunate to work closely with designers and developers on various products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have always had an interest in working across digital platforms and activiely seek out new opportunities to lean new skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                   I have completed several online courses about the fundamentals of front-end development, SEO, responsive design, and programming languages including JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am also keen to learn about fundamental digital marketing principles, audience research, SEO and competitor analysis, and how to create successful campaigns. 
                    I also have an interest in search engine optimisation and often read the latest developments in this area from various sources including Search Engine Journal, SEMRush, and Hrefs. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I continue to learn as much as I can and look forward to the next challenge where I can learn and apply new skills to a high standard and advance my professional development.

                In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with friends out on walks or playing console and tabletop games. 
                I am a Dungeons and Dragons fan and would one day like to have the skills to develop an in-game tool using the Foundry platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also enjoy trying mini coding projects to practice with languages I have learned and will happily conduct research into possible solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I spend a lot of my time reading, particularly fiction and fantasy novels, history books, and the occasional autobiography.
